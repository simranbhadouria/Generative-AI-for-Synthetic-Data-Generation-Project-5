# Generative-AI-for-Synthetic-Data-Generation--Project-5


Project:

Generative AI for Synthetic Data Generation & Analytics( Healthcare data)

Objective:

Generate realistic synthetic datasets to augment limited real-world data, then visualize and validate data similarity.

Tools:
Python
PyTorch (for GAN)
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn (optional for preprocessing/validation)

Conclusion

The project successfully implemented a GAN-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produced realistic and statistically consistent datasets. By augmenting limited real-world data, it improved model robustness while ensuring data privacy and scalability. This demonstrates the practical value of Generative AI in addressing real-world challenges related to data scarcity and ethical data use.
